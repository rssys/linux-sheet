### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

install with pip

```
pip install ClarkSheets
```

### Using the Program

There are 2 ways to use the program:

1. You can run it with python3 on a CSV file and start using it, ex:

```
python3 Clark_Sheets.py some_file.csv
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Go into test_cases and each subdirectory to run each test case(I will make a bash script to run all of them at once soon)

## Things I'd like to add

* individual resizable columns
* general resizable columns
* perhaps multiple pads to increase the dimensions this program can handle (right now I am only using one pad and it's max dimensions seem to be 32768 rows by 702 cols)
* when searching implement a next option to cycle through all matches
* customizable key key_mappings
* formulas
